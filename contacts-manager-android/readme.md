## Contacts Manager in Android

### What you need to do?

* Take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) if you haven’t already.
* Create a private repo called “yipl-android-assignment” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Do as instructed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple number of commits with proper messages) 
* Invite bitbucket@yipl.com.np to your particular private repo
* Invite bitbucket@yipl.com.np to your MBaaS platform

### Assignment

Create a contact database using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or any other MBaaS platform (like [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/), or [Backendless](https://backendless.com/)) that saves user’s full name, address, contact number and image. Your app should
* List existing contacts,
* Show contact detail page,
* Add/Edit new contact,
* Batch sync newly added contact information using a background service or a job scheduler.

Once contact information is loaded (both listing and detail) data should persist. Any persistance mechnism can be used, i.e., cache or database.

Design as you wish, keeping material design principles in mind.

### Criteria for judgement

* Object Oriented approach used in project.
* Use of staple 3rd party Android libraries; [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/), [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), and [Dependency Injection](https://google.github.io/dagger/).
* Proper naming conventions for XML and Java files.
* Proper use of ViewGroup(s) and View(s).
* Proper use of Android API(s).
* Project structure.


### Bonus points

* Using Kotlin for development.
* Use of relevant design patterns.
* Basic Unit and Functional testing included.
* If you can use relevant 'Material Design' components in your application.
* If you write readme file with screenshots and short description of your application.
